By proceeding, you confirm and agree to the following:

### 1. LAWFUL DATA COLLECTION

You will only submit data obtained lawfully from public, first-party, or licensed resale sources. You will not use paid databases (e.g., Apollo, ZoomInfo, PDL, etc.) without resale agreements or breach any website's terms of service.

### 2. OWNERSHIP & LICENSE GRANT

You own or have the right to share all data you submit. You grant Leadpoet an irrevocable, worldwide license to store, validate, sell, and distribute that data to third parties.

### 3. ACCURACY & INTEGRITY

You will submit accurate, non-fraudulent, and non-duplicative information. You will cooperate with audits or validation requests if needed.

### 4. RESTRICTED SOURCES

You agree not to use any prohibited data brokers, private APIs, or scraped contact databases without proper authorization. Restricted sources include (but are not limited to):

- ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, People Data Labs
- RocketReach, Hunter.io, Snov.io
- Lusha, Clearbit, LeadIQ

You may only use such sources if you have a valid resale agreement and provide proof via license document hash.

### 5. RESALE RIGHTS

You acknowledge that Leadpoet and its buyers may resell, enrich, and redistribute approved leads.

### 6. COMPLIANCE & TAKEDOWNS

If a takedown request or legal issue arises from your submission, Leadpoet may remove your data and freeze all future earned rewards. You agree to respond to compliance inquiries within 10 business days.

### 7. INDEMNIFICATION

You accept responsibility for your submissions. If your data causes a legal claim against Leadpoet, you agree to indemnify Leadpoet against losses or damages.

### 8. TERMS VERSION TRACKING

Your agreement will be tied to a specific terms_version_hash for audit purposes. If terms are updated, you must re-accept them before mining resumes.

### 9. PRIVACY

No personal KYC data is collected; your wallet address is your identity. Leadpoet only logs your wallet, timestamp, and accepted version hash for compliance.

### 10. TERMINATION

Leadpoet may suspend contributors who violate these terms or who fail audits. Suspended miners will not receive rewards for any pending leads.

## Detailed Explanation

### Lawful Data Collection (Section 1)

**What This Means:**
- You may ONLY submit data you obtained legally
- Acceptable sources: public registries (LinkedIn, Crunchbase), company websites, first-party forms you operate, licensed resale agreements
- Prohibited: Scraping data in violation of terms of service, using paid databases without resale rights, stolen databases

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Allowed:** Data from your own website's contact form
- ✅ **Allowed:** Public LinkedIn profiles (respecting LinkedIn's terms)
- ✅ **Allowed:** Data from Apollo.io IF you have a resale agreement with Apollo
- ❌ **Prohibited:** Scraping Apollo.io without permission
- ❌ **Prohibited:** Using a "cracked" database from the dark web
- ❌ **Prohibited:** Breaching a website's terms of service to collect data

### Ownership & License Grant (Section 2)

**What This Means:**
- You must own the data or have permission to share it
- By submitting, you grant Leadpoet an **irrevocable** license
- This means you cannot later revoke our right to use the data
- Leadpoet can sell, redistribute, and enrich the data

**Important:** This is a broad license. Once submitted, the data becomes part of Leadpoet's commercial inventory.

### Accuracy & Integrity (Section 3)

**What This Means:**
- Submit real, accurate data
- No fake leads, no spam, no duplicates
- If we request an audit, you must cooperate

**Consequences of Fraud:**
- Immediate suspension from network
- Forfeiture of all pending rewards
- Potential legal action

### Restricted Sources (Section 4)

**What This Means:**
- Certain data brokers are restricted unless you have resale rights
- Restricted list includes: ZoomInfo, Apollo, PDL, RocketReach, Hunter.io, Snov.io, Lusha, Clearbit, LeadIQ

**How to Use Restricted Sources Legally:**
1. Obtain a resale agreement from the data broker
2. Generate a SHA-256 hash of your license document
3. Include the hash when submitting leads
4. Validators will verify the hash matches an uploaded document

### Resale Rights (Section 5)

**What This Means:**
- Leadpoet will resell your submitted leads to buyers
- Buyers may further resell or redistribute

**What This Means:**
- If someone requests removal of their contact info, we will honor it

**Example Scenario:**
1. You submit john@acme.com
2. John (CEO of Acme) submits a GDPR erasure request

4. If we determine you submitted data unlawfully, we freeze your rewards and investigate

### Indemnification (Section 7)

**What This Means:**
- If Leadpoet gets sued because of your data, you agree to cover legal costs

### Terms Version Tracking (Section 8)

**What This Means:**
- These terms may be updated periodically
- Each version has a unique SHA-256 hash

## Acceptance Process

### First-Time Setup

When you run the miner for the first time:

1. Full terms are displayed in terminal
2. You are prompted: "Do you accept these terms? (Y/N)"
3. If you type **Y**, your acceptance is recorded locally and synced to Supabase
4. Mining begins

### Terms Updates

If we update the terms:

1. Next time you start your miner, you'll see: "Terms have been updated"
2. New terms are displayed
3. You must accept again to continue mining
4. Your new acceptance is recorded with updated timestamp

### Attestation Storage

Your attestation is stored in **three places** for security:

1. **Local file:** `data/regulatory/miner_attestation.json`
2. **Supabase database:** `contributor_attestations` table (source of truth)
3. **Lead metadata:** Embedded in each lead you submit

This three-layer system prevents manipulation and ensures auditability.

## Enforcement

### Validator Verification

Every lead you submit goes through validation:

1. **Pre-Attestation Check:** Validators check that you have a valid attestation in the database
2. **Source Provenance Verification:** Validators verify your source provenance (URL, type, denylist)
3. **Standard checks:** Email validation, domain age, etc.
4. **Deep verification:** 5% random sample + 100% of licensed resale

### Consequences of Violation

- **First offense:** Warning, lead rejected
- **Repeat offenses:** Temporary suspension (e.g., 7 days)
- **Serious violations:** Permanent ban, all pending rewards forfeited
- **Fraud:** Legal action, indemnification claim

## Questions and Clarifications

### Can I use my own proprietary database?

**Yes**, if you collected the data lawfully and own it. Set both `source_url` and `source_type` to `proprietary_database` (both fields must match for validation to pass).

### Can I use LinkedIn Sales Navigator?

**Only if** you comply with LinkedIn's terms of service. Do not scrape in violation of their TOS.

### Can I use data from my company's CRM?

**Only if** your company owns the data and has given you permission to share it.

### What if I made an honest mistake?

Contact us immediately at hello@leadpoet.com. Honest mistakes are handled differently than intentional fraud.

### Can I revoke my acceptance?

No. Acceptance is irrevocable. However, you can stop mining at any time by not running your miner.
